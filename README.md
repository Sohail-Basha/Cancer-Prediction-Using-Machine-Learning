# Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning to analyze medical data and predict whether a tumor is cancerous or non-cancerous. The goal is to support early cancer detection using data.

## Overview
This project is about predicting cancer using machine learning.
The model analyzes medical data and predicts whether a tumor is
cancerous or non-cancerous.
Early detection of cancer is very important, and this project
shows how machine learning can help in that process.

---

## Problem Statement
Cancer diagnosis usually takes time and multiple tests.
Machine learning can help by analyzing medical data and
giving fast and useful predictions.
This project uses patient data to predict if a tumor is dangerous
or not dangerous.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains medical information related to tumors.
- Each row represents a patient record.
- The data is used to train and test the machine learning model.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

---

## Machine Learning Process
1. Load the medical dataset
2. Clean and prepare the data
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a machine learning model
5. Test the model accuracy
6. Save the trained model

The trained model is saved as `model.pkl`.
